# Jack Hanke's Repositories

### Welcome to my GitHub page. Here I post work on combinatorics, and machine learning. 

In terms of machine learning I am most proud of my `MNISTfromScratch` repo,  where I programmed a neural network using just NumPy. This work closely follows Michael Nielsen's [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) textbook. 

In terms of combinatorics, I am most proud of deriving a generating function for the number of [minimal inscribed polyforms](https://digitalcommons.lib.uconn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1938&context=srhonors_theses) in the extended general aztec diamond $\rho(A^{S^*}_{n,m})$. This work can be found in the `minimal-insribed-polyform` repo.

I am also very proud of my enumeration of the number of mosaics in  the $n \times 2$ and $n \times 3$ retangular lattice. If we let $t_{n,2}$ denote the number of mosaics in the $n\times 2$ grid, then we have

$$\sum_{n \geq 2}t_{n,2}x^n = \frac{x^2}{(1-36x)(1-37x+37x^2)}$$

This work can be found in the `mosaics` repo. The associated [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3dp5RBmPcs&t=154s) video was one of the 25 winners of the thrid [Summer of Math Exposition Contest](https://some.3b1b.co/previous) hosted by 3Blue1Brown.
