# Hi, I'm Jack Hanke. Welcome to my GitHub page! üëæ

## I have a passion for machine learning, mathematics, and educational outreach.

In terms of machine learning I am most proud of my work in the `nets` repo, where I program the following neural network architectures just using `NumPy`:
- ‚úîÔ∏è Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
- ‚úîÔ∏è Variational Autoencoder (VAE)
- ‚úîÔ∏è Latent Denoising Diffusion Model (LDDPM)
- ‚úîÔ∏è Multi Head Attention (MHA)
- ‚úîÔ∏è Temporal Difference Agent (TD Agent) with a [RAMNet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAMnets), in `2048rl` repo


In terms of mathematics, I am most proud of my work in the `minimal-insribed-polyforms` repo, where I enumerate many different [minimal inscribed polyforms](https://digitalcommons.lib.uconn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1938&context=srhonors_theses). Some of these enumerations can be found on the [OEIS](https://oeis.org/) ([A356888](https://oeis.org/search?q=A356888&language=english&go=Search) and [A356889](https://oeis.org/search?q=A356889&language=english&go=Search)). Below is one of my favorite examples of a set of minimal inscribed polyforms, an $n=5$ triangle of hexagons.

I showed that the number of minimal inscribed polyforms $s_n$ for the analogous triangle of size $n$ is

$$s_n = \binom{2(n-1)}{n-1} - \sum_{k=0}^{n-2}\binom{2k}{k}.$$


In terms of outreach, I am most proud of my work in the `mosaics` repo, where I enumerate the number of mosaics in the $n \times 2$ and $n \times 3$ rectangular lattice. The associated [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3dp5RBmPcs&t=154s) video was one of the 25 winners of the third [Summer of Math Exposition Contest](https://some.3b1b.co/previous) hosted by 3Blue1Brown.
